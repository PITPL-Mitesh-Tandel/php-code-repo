The architecture response poses a sober face to the community housing and opens to a Mango grove with expansive terraces. </p>\n<p>\nOur lighting design approach is to bridge this inside outside relation with medium of electric light. The site offers carefully crafted vistas from this dynamic house and create several lighting scenarios and atmospheres to be displayed, easily thanks to the automation system, as per client needs. </p>\n\n<p>\nAtelier dada planned the master plan for the whole house, but selected only the architectural fittings while the decorative ones were choice of the client and architects. At the trial time, Atelier dada helped with focusing and reorganizing the decorative fittings in the space to respond the best to the design intent. </p>",

Atelier dada took this idea further ahead with use of media lines that permit more flexibility at use and are more energy efficient with use of subtle programming. </p>\n\n<p>\nThe lights have been custom designed to fit the varying length diagonal lines of the sun shades and been fitted with custom designed press fit mounting clamps in screen box sections. The box sections were customized to keep the LED media bars flush with the profile and thus become totally integral during the day. By night, the light offers unobtrusive views for occupants even while lights are on and became an architectural element defining medium and almost a tangible part of the design.\n\n</p>",

From the inside, these lines create a rhythmic that respects the functionality of the premises and manages the networks between what they are recessed. They get reflected on the glazed façade, duplicate and so give an illusion of infinity. They refract on cars' shine, adding a sort of strength and vitality, and creating a unique visual identity to the showroom that attracts from far.\n\n</p><p>\nAbove the reception desk, a decorative suspension with dynamic light, itself a twisted line, focuses the eye on that space and creates a centrality in the showroom. </p>",

However, we succeeded in pursuing the client and architect to reduce the number of lights/ locate them discreetly/ lower the source location in room for cosy ambience and utmost visual comfort. We had also helped achieve custom fittings above the dining tables that reveal the wooden ceiling and at the same time act as accent light for the tables. Or concealed lights for accentuating tables and sculptural niches. </p>\n<p>\nFor outdoor stone pavilions also we had suggested buried lights that discreetly accentuate the building while kept low height glowing bollard along the green alleyway to guide softly the client while keeping focus on the illuminated architectural elements.</p>",
