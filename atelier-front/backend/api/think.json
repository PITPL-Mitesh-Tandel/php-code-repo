You’d jump in, explain where you need to go, and on arrival, fumble in your pocket or purse while feverishly working out the right level of tip to offer and making sure you didn’t lose the receipt, which was either the size of a postage stamp or a club flyer. Now…  you wait in the warm, knowing exactly when the car (make, model and reg number) will arrive - you know the driver’s name, he/she knows yours, where you’re going, you say hello, they say hello and goodbye, it’s paid for and a digital receipt arrives 30 seconds later, with a map of where you went to remind you.</p>\r\n<p>Perfect - the physical, digital and human worlds working neatly together - everything much more rewarding and easy. Except, now when we see the little car icon on the screen indicating whereabouts the driver is on his route to get you - you scream, “Why did he go that way, if he’d taken the first left he would have been here in two minutes, not three.” There’s no pleasing some people.</p>\r\n<p>It doesn’t matter whether you’re a baby boomer, Gen X, Y or Z, we are more demanding and expectant than ever - we live in a user experience world where OK is no longer OK.  Today the experiences we have are directly related to the service we perceive we’re getting. This becomes even more important to the younger end of “Generation Picky” - the millennials and the Generation Z’s are shifting dramatically in their appreciation of, and spending habits with, brands and retailers.</p>",

While most of this activity is digital, they will also plan store visits as excursions - not individually but en masse with friends.</p>\r\n<p>Retailer response: Access</p>\r\n<p>Fashion retailer Urban Outfitters is great at accessing the Gen Z shopper's interest points, encouraging online scrapbooking and providing an inviting physical store presence.</p>\r\n<p>Touch-points</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Google</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Brand websites</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Bookmarked websites</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">MMS photos</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Website screen grabs/iPhone print screen</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Up to three store visits</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>3. <span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Decision making</span></h3>\r\n<p>Gen Z will seek approval from their peers, delaying gratification in case something better comes along, while constantly tracking prices using apps. These savvy shoppers may set a product ceiling price, buying only when the price falls below that level.</p>\r\n<p>Retailer response: Reassurance</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Sneaker retailer Foot Locker became reassuring by launching Sneakerpedia, a website that gained a reputation for offering solid information and advice on sneakers, from bona fide 'sneaker pimps'. The site didn't carry any Foot Locker branding until two years after launch, so the respect it had gained over that period was authentic and lent Foot Locker massive credibility.</span></p>\r\n<p>Touchpoints</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Price comparison sites</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Repeat store visits</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>4.

They have mosaic identities that are as virtual as they are physical. When making a purchase, they actively weigh the pros and cons of both store and online purchases, but tend to buy more online.</span></p>\r\n<p>In contrast with the offline world, th<span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">ey experience magnified self-esteem and influence online. While the universal condition of being a teen is, and always has been, a state of waiting for growth, freedom and independence, these desires are now more satisfied online.

            "OneColumnText": "<p>Generosity, most simply defined, is the habit of giving without expecting anything in return. The key word here is 'habit'. In a highly evolved brand or business, generosity should become part of the muscle memory of the business, not a marketing campaign. It should be so deeply ingrained in the culture and behaviors of a company and its employees that it happens organically and spontaneously. <span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">And yet, while we all know doing good is the right thing, the knowledge alone rarely spurs us into action </span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Why is generosity important to retailers? </span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Today's shopper cares. Generations X, Y and Z will essentially represent the global audience for retailers and brands within the next five years. This group shares an overwhelming belief that all of us need to work together to change our world. And they are voting with their wallets, rewarding brands that align with their beliefs with loyalty and a deep, emotional bond. X, Y and Z will signal a profound shift in shoppers' expectations of how businesses need to act to respond to the challenges our world is facing. </span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">What can we learn from X, Y and Z? </span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Just giving won't cut it. Almost every business gives money to charity. And while on paper that's great, being generous means taking this altruism and activating it. This new generation of shoppers sees business as a far more effective vehicle for change than government and they expect companies to step up. </span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">You can't boil the ocean</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">It's more important for Generous Brands to focus on close-in issues with direct action, rather than stating generic and lofty goals that can never be achieved. From water shortages to super storms; from cyber crime to huge income gaps; from immigration issues to education; from an aging population to everyday healthcare, we need to stop trying to \"End World [insert worthy cause]\" and recognize that much needs to be done closer to all of our homes. </span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Action trumps purpose </span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">For these new generations of shoppers WHAT you do is more important and meaningful than WHY you do it. While having a mission and believing in it is important (especially for Gen X), a worthy mission is trumped by action. Good citizenship today means being a game changer. </span></p>\r\n<p><em><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">\"We gave $150 million in donations a year but we didn't really DO anything. We let somebody else pick up the food and it just disappeared. We didn't use our skills and our people. We didn't make a difference in ways that we could.\"<br /></span></em><em style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Ron Shaich, Founder and Executive Chairman at Panera Bread and founder of <a href=\"http://paneracares.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Panera Cares</a> cafes</span></em></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Focus on what matters</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">While purpose shouldn't trump action, no brand will be seen as generous if it doesn't address issues that are meaningful to shoppers. It's not possible to have a conversation about how business needs to change to align with the next generation without discussing the environment. When teens were recently polled globally on their top 10 concerns, 5 of them related to the environment. The top 5 as it turns out. </span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">It's the environment, stupid. </span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Simply cleaning up your past mistakes does not make you a Generous Brand. Generous Brands have to go further, investing their money, their time and their efforts to changing our future, without expecting the customer to pick up one cent of the cost. Buildings, which include stores, are the largest contributors of carbon emissions on plant earth. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">It's time for retail to step up. But it has to go further than just clearing up our own mess. A true Generous Brand would go further. And they do. Unilever's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWTVCkvQzY8\" target=\"_blank\">Project Sunlight</a>, for example, aims to build a new generation of leaders. It's just one of the initiatives Unilever has undertaken over the last few years to transform its business. </span></p>\r\n<p><em><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">\"Achieving goals is not just a job for politicians and governments – everyone needs to play their part.\" <br /></span></em><em style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Paul Polman, CEO, Unilever</span></em></p>\r\n<!--EndFragment-->",

Of the 28 western fashion retailers identified as having goods produced in this building, only 9 attended the initial meeting to discuss compensation to the families of the victims. Of those 9 companies only 4 agreed to pay compensation. It took two years in the courts to finally get the compensation paid.</p>\r\n<p>Despite the companies concerned making a collected annual profit of over $20 billion in 2014, the compensation fund topped out at $30 million. Or $6,000 for each family who could prove they had a claim. Retail had a chance to do the right thing, and we failed.</p>\r\n<p>The case is clear. Retail, one of the biggest industries on planet earth can make an almost unfathomable difference to our world, if only we start acting with generosity. It's not that we are doing nothing, it's just that we could be doing so much more. We bring joy to people on a daily basis. Let's spread this joy and do the right thing. And we really don't have any choice, to quote a hero of mine, Buckminster Fuller:</p>\r\n<p><em>\"We are not going to be able to operate this Spaceship Earth successfully, nor for much longer, unless we see our fate as common.

It examined how in this web-fueled world we are losing our ability to focus, and are becoming – or, more likely, have already become – addicted to distraction.</p>\r\n<p>The net result of this reality is that today spaces are filled with people spending so much of their time in the digital world that they are having a hard time immersing themselves in the physical one.</p>\r\n<p>Against this backdrop, it's my hope that on this year's D&amp;AD Spatial &amp; Experiential Jury we get to see spaces that are swimming against this tide, drawing people in and wrapping us in experiences that create meaning and which move us. Moments and memories we can't wait to share with friends in person and, yes, on our social feeds...but which will resonate and stay with us long after we have walked away.</p>\r\n<p>These places may well be fuelled by digital moments, content and stories. But they absolutely should not be defined by this content. They have to be something more.</p>\r\n<p>I want a return to the poetry of places. To the type of experiences that raise your heartbeat. Take your breath away. Literally stop you in your tracks.</p>\r\n<p>There were no Yellow Pencils in this category last year. As someone who was on the Jury panel it was clear why. Submission after submission which simply took a digital campaign, placed it in a space (often with no connection to that space) and called that 'place making'. It is not.</p>\r\n<p>But there are still those spaces which rise above:</p>\r\n<p>Diller Scofidio and Renfro's Sublime work for the High Line, which won a <a href=\"http://www.dandad.org/en/high-line/\" target=\"_blank\">D&amp;AD Black Pencil</a> in 2010.</p>",

This concept is brought to life by the tailoring school that lives in the store itself. Behind a large glass door, shoppers can watch the tailors busily at work on other customers' orders.

There will always be a small proportion of shoppers who get a kick out of grabbing a bargain, no matter how hostile the experience, but the majority are sensible human beings who are in control and able to make their own decisions. Moreover, they are happily buying online, at home.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Maincopy\"><span>The losers are the retailers. Black Friday discounts drive shoppers to open their wallets earlier, not deeper, so the idea that they are a major boost to UK Christmas spending is flawed. Given that discounting also erodes brand equity, the commercial case for retailers to participate is weak. So who wins? Everything points to the multi-brand online discounters, specifically Amazon. It was Amazon who introduced Black Friday to the UK five years ago and, this year, 84%1 of shoppers say they will do their Black Friday shopping with the online giant. It is no wonder a backlash has begun, with a small number </span><span>of retailers opting out of Black Friday and using the opportunity to tell a positive </span><span>brand story.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Maincopy\"><span>We predict that Britain’s Black Friday will become the domain of the discounters and turn into just another discounting day in the run-up to Christmas. We see more fabricated shopping days arriving on our calendars, too. There is an opportunity here for a brand to create a more positive day that is not based on discounting and which offers a unique </span><span>experience that is true to the brand. For example, imagine someone like Primark launching a fun and frivolous shopping </span><span>day on 1st April next year.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Maincopy\"><span>The long-term winners will be the brands offering a continuous experience online and in-store. Shoppers are spending more time online, making decisions and narrowing down their choices before buying in-store. This growing trend of ‘webrooming’ means that brands need to expand access to information online, while creating rewarding and unique physical experiences in store. However, </span><span>it does require a major shift in mindset for retailers: from selling to helping people buy.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\"> </span></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"> </p>",

No queues, no hassle and no stress. The only discomfort they are likely to experience is forgetting their slippers as they settle down at their computer on a slightly chilly November morning.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Maincopy\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">A Retail Week poll of shoppers who made a purchase on Black Friday 2014 revealed that 58% did so via a computer at home, while 29% used a mobile device and opted for home delivery. Scaremongering stories of shoppers wrestling in the aisles and police being called serve only to remind the great British shopper of what they should do their best to avoid.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Maincopy\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">The truth is, Black Friday is a positive experience for shoppers. The same poll also showed that 96% of shoppers who bought on Black Friday were either very or quite satisfied. Not exactly shopping pandemonium.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Maincopy\"><strong>1.2 FOMO AFFECTS THE FEW</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"Maincopy\">While most Black Friday bargains are available online, there are plenty of in-store-only deals to be had. These loss leaders are used to drive awareness and traffic: 34% of Black Friday shoppers visited a physical store last year. <br /> So what is it that drives these individuals to take on the much-hyped Retail Armageddon?</p>\r\n<p class=\"Maincopy\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Björk makes an interesting case in her song Human Behaviour:</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Maincopy\">If you ever get close to a human</p>\r\n<p class=\"Maincopy\">And human behaviour</p>\r\n<p class=\"Maincopy\">Be ready, be ready to get confused</p>\r\n<p class=\"Maincopy\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">There’s definitely, definitely, </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">definitely no logic</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Maincopy\">To human behaviour</p>\r\n<p class=\"Maincopy\">But yet so, yet so irresistible</p>\r\n<p class=\"Maincopy\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">And there’s no map</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Maincopy\">And the compass</p>\r\n<p class=\"Maincopy\">Wouldn’t help at all<span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Maincopy\">The lyrics make a simple point: that we cannot rely on rational, logical ideas to anticipate human behaviour. To get under the skin of people and understand how and why people shop, we need to understand their shopping mind-states.<span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Maincopy\">We know that 75% of Black Friday shoppers start the day with a strategy. They have already been dreaming and exploring online (cf. FITCH paper on The Joy of Shopping), they know what they want and they have located it. Now it is time to buy it. For the majority this is online but, as we know, one-third of shoppers still go to a store. The keenest queue up in the cold, waiting for the doors to open; for the rest it’s the battle to get there before stocks run dry.</p>\r\n<p>This behaviour is FOMO, the fear of missing out. This acronym was coined a couple of years ago to describe a psychological disorder caused by the onward march of technology, but its use <br /> is certainly appropriate for bargain shopping within a time-limit.<em style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\"> </em></p>\r\n<p class=\"Maincopy\"><strong>1.3 NOT FOR EVERYONE</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"Maincopy\">Black Friday originates from the US and has evolved from bargain shopping to a major lifestyle event.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Maincopy\">Now that many retailers open up on Thanksgiving Day, the appeal of Black Friday <br /> as a day for deals appears to be waning. However, the appeal of spending the day with family and good friends is alive and well, from families in matching outfits to special breakfasts and sleepovers the night before. It is more about tradition than transactions over there. The introduction by Amazon of Prime DayA in July this year indicates that the <br /> world’s biggest e-tailer is trying <br /> to stay one step ahead.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Maincopy\">Over in China, of course, there’s an example that dwarfs the lot. Home grown online retailer Alibaba has been making billions since 2009 by turning an unofficial holiday called Singles’ Day into the biggest online shopping day of the yearB. As Alibaba eyes international expansionC, we could see yet another discount day being <br /> added to our calendars.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Maincopy\">Amazon only introduced Black Friday to China in 2014, so it’s still too early to tell how this new ‘holiday’ will catch on. What is clear, though, is that there’s room for more retailers to get in on the action, since growth in retail sales for most Asian nations is projected to be higher than the global average. </p>\r\n<p>So, Black Friday is a fabricated discount day in the UK and certainly no holiday unless the Queen decrees it. Clearly it is not for everyone. With this in mind, we have put together a simple and brief shopping guide.</p>",

So surely it must be good news for retailers?</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Maincopy\">Actually no. Black Friday discounts drive shoppers to spend earlier rather than to spend more. In the UK, £1 in every £3 of transactions is conducted through Visa’s payment system. |Their data from last year shows that while overall spending increased by 2.1% last November compared with the same month a year previously, in the December it rose by just 1%. And on a month-by-month measure, it gained by 1.7% in November but then fell by 2.8% in December.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Maincopy\">Black Friday is robbing Peter to pay Paul.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Maincopy\">This diagram representing John Lewis consumer electronics sales last Christmas illustrates the point. Black Friday activity increased sales at the expense of Christmas sales.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Maincopy\">Despite Argos’s Black Friday shopping frenzy in 2014, which led to a 45% surge in sales, there was a sharp drop-off in demand in the following weeks. Like-for-like sales grew just 0.1%, compared with the estimated 2% in the 18 weeks to 3 January. As a direct result of Black Friday discounting, Argos missed its sales forecasts and recorded reduced profits.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Maincopy\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Homebase sales for the 2014 Christmas period were up only 0.6%, despite heavy Black Friday promotion. Its shares fell 7% at this news.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Maincopy\">Marks &amp; Spencer clothing and homeware sales were down 5.8% in the Christmas period of 2014, and there were similar stories amongst the supermarkets: Sainsbury’s sales for this period were down 1.7%, Tesco’s were down 0.3%. Asda’s were down 2.6%, so not a great surprise when the supermarket chain announced in mid-November that it would not participate.19 Marks &amp; Spencer CEO Marc Bolland blamed Black Friday discounting for much of the drop in sales. Mothercare, by contrast, held out against the Black Friday frenzy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Maincopy\"> </p>\r\n<p class=\"Maincopy\"> </p>",

At midday, customers queued for up to an hour, listening to the message, “We’re really sorry that the huge demand for our deals means you’re having to wait.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Maincopy\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">At Tesco, deals went live at midnight but the website was down for several hours. For M&amp;S, delivery times had to double. Oasis’s Black Friday 2014 resulted in a 50% return rate from all orders.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Maincopy\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">So the commercial case is weak for retailers, the experience can be poor for shoppers and brand equity is likely to be eroded. Surely there must be a backlash?</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Maincopy\"><strong>2.3 The Backlash</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Yes, there are signs of a potential backlash. The most interesting example is from America, </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">where REI outdoor stores are shutting their doors and giving staff the time off. They recognise the importance of keeping staff happy in creating long-term sustainable advantage. The Harvard Service-Profit Chain is based upon this premise. Their empirical evidence proves that happy employees bring happy customers who in turn bring more profit. REI embraces this with messages such as “Get outside and enjoy the day.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Ocado chairman Lord Stuart Rose described Black Friday as an “extremely bad idea”. He said that a number of retailers have now decided that “their margins have not improved, they’ve been eroded. They’ve gotten themselves in a hole that they’ve got to get themselves out of this year.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Maincopy\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">We believe the smarter, bolder brands will abstain.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Maincopy\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\"> </span></p>",

Follow Alasdair on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/isawthismorning\" target=\"_blank\">@isawthismorning.</a></em></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">When the news broke that Little Red, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/06/virgin-atlantic-scraps-little-red-service\" target=\"_blank\">Virgin's domestic airline was to be closed</a>, its impact was more of a splutter than a big bang. Had it been Virgin Atlantic going under however, it would have been front page news. By killing off Little Red quickly rather than letting it die a slow, lingering death, Virgin Group limited the brand damage.</span></p>\r\n<p>As Robert Kennedy said: \"Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly\". Shutting down Little Red fits with Richard Branson's entrepreneurial reputation and also contributes to the confidence and decisiveness of the Virgin brand.</p>\r\n<p>In truth, this failure won't damage it. In fact, it will tell the world that the brand knows when to stop and is capable of making bold decisions.</p>\r\n<p>So just how easy is it to keep your identity across so many different variations? How do these brands measure their success and keep customers loyal?</p>\r\n<p>Virgin's monolithic architecture certainly poses some risks. It uses one name for all of its products and services, meaning that if a problem affects one of those sub-brands, it may affect all of them. However, this strategy also increases marketing efficiency, meaning that one strong sub-brand can lead to the success of another.</p>\r\n<h3>EasyGroup</h3>\r\n<p>Stelios Haji-Ioannou's <a href=\"http://easy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">easyGroup</a> has successfully launched sub-brands from property to pizza to gyms, and the company is currently expanding into the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23570343\" target=\"_blank\">grocery category</a>. The common denominator of their offering in each sector is value.</p>\r\n<p>Both easyGroup and Virgin inspire brand loyalty by sticking to strong, defined strategies.</p>\r\n<h3>Apple</h3>\r\n<p>The success of <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple's</a> brand extensions is proof that if you can make an emotional connection with your customer it gives you a greater freedom to extend your brand. With every new product that Apple makes, be it computers, laptops, phones or music players, the common denominator is iTunes.</p>\r\n<p>iTunes is probably the most important product in their portfolio as it moves seamlessly across its products, is easy to use and Apple's customers are already familiar with it. Apple ensures that its customers are comfortable, which helps to reduce the risk of failure and allowing it to build on its recognition and reputation.</p>\r\n<p>Little wonder that on 20 October, Apple said its quarterly profit had risen by 13%, and it had sold 39.3m iPhones in the period ended 27 September, marking a 16% increase from 33.8m units in the previous year.</p>\r\n<h3>Less successful ventures</h3>\r\n<p>The right extension should fit with the existing brand identity. If the new product doesn't fit, the extension can be seen as confusing and could weaken the existing brand. Bic, known for its disposable razors and pens, decided to move into disposable underwear. Needless to say the brand bombed, as the customer's association with Bic wasn't flexible enough to withstand the move into underwear.</p>\r\n<p>Brand extensions must be a logical fit with consumer's expectations. Vespa Scooters has just announced that they are launching a <a href=\"http://www.vespafragrances.com/\" target=\"_blank\">new range of fragrances</a> for men and women. Whilst their scooters are iconic I have a feeling the fragrances won't be.</p>\r\n<p>Let's not forget Heineken's <a href=\"http://www.licensemag.com/license-global/heineken-debuts-shoe-collab\" target=\"_blank\">move into shoes</a> and Harley Davidson's <a href=\"http://realbusiness.co.uk/article/26961-6-worst-brand-extensions-from-famous-companies\" target=\"_blank\">cake decorating kit</a>. The critical factor in extending is that the distinctive product owned by the brand fits seamlessly in its new category.</p>\r\n<p>So while the Virgin Group has had a number of failures, such as Virgin Cola and Virgin Brides, the crash of Little Red hasn't affected the strength of the Virgin brand or its reputation, but rather enhanced its decisiveness and boldness.</p>\r\n<p>Virgin's common denominator between brands is its unconventional approach to marketing and its 'flying in the face of ordinary' customer service. And with Branson at the helm, a man known for his (extremely calculated) risk-taking, the Virgin name will continue to fly.</p>",

The shop is focused on encouraging customers of all ages to play. It is more of a theme park, a destination in its own right, than a pure retail outlet, being made up of zones including an enchanted forest to explore, motor-city with a go-kart track, and a safari section.</p>\r\n<p>But why has Hamleys designed such a store and moreover, why is play becoming increasingly important for all kinds of brands?</p>\r\n<p>We all have a natural instinct to play. However, by the time we reach adulthood, that instinct has been thwarted by social conventions and inhibitions.</p>\r\n<p>Yet play is an important part of human nature that not only helps our creativity but helps us learn – it’s beneficial to us and not something we are likely to evolve out of anytime soon.</p>\r\n<p>In fact, I’m sure many of you reading this already play with items in-store: mobile phones in the likes of Carphone Warehouse, kitchen utensils in homeware stores, and maybe even fruit in the local supermarket. We all want to experience the product before we purchase.</p>\r\n<p>For brands, the opportunity is huge: unlock this instinct and benefit from a deeper-level of engagement. This is even more relevant as technology distracts brands from the value of physical space.</p>\r\n<h3>Brand must create an experience that asks 'what can we do with you?' rather than 'what can we do for you?'</h3>\r\n<p>Because of the <a class=\" u-underline\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2015/mar/18/sxsw-2015-retail-shopping-technology-revival\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" data-component=\"in-body-link\">exponential growth of e-tailers, brick-and-mortar retailers</a>, in particular, have the opportunity to offer an experience that sets them apart from their online competitors. By offering a playful environment that builds and maintains a personal connection with consumers – a human experience – retailers will provide something priceless for their customers to take home: a lasting impression. In a crowded market, the emphasis on valuable in-store experiences presents a competitive proposition to lean e-commerce pricing structures.</p>\r\n<p>To create an engaging playful environment brands need to move away from traditional storytelling to drive interactions with people that are unique and personable. This invariably involves a collaborative approach to communication. Brands must create an experience with their audience that asks ‘what can we do with you?’ rather than ‘what can we do for you?’</p>\r\n<p>This is what we had in mind when we designed the Hamleys store in Moscow. We created those nine zones to offer consumers something unique to take away. Each zone mixes interactive attractions, entertainment and retail in a way that’s designed to stimulate the senses. As well as the motor city and enchanted forest examples above, in space there’s a full-scale replica of the Millennium Falcon, and in Lego there’s a 13-metre tall Lego rocket.</p>\r\n<h3>Global expansion</h3>\r\n<p>Other brands are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of play. The US clothing and footwear brand Vans opened <a class=\" u-underline\" href=\"http://houseofvanslondon.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" data-component=\"in-body-link\">The House of Vans</a> last year in the tunnels under Waterloo station. Rather than being a retail outlet it offers London’s only permanent indoor skate park, art gallery, live music venue and cinema with exciting events and exhibitions that change regularly. It’s a place where people can experience and interact with the brand in a much more informal setting, which in turn helps Vans build long-term relationships with consumers.</p>\r\n<p>Play environments are also starting to be created in car showrooms. <a class=\" u-underline\" href=\"https://www.audi.co.uk/audi-innovation/audi-city.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" data-component=\"in-body-link\">Audi City in London</a> includes a tech-enhanced space where visitors are encouraged to explore and configure their ideal car using touchscreens and multi-sensory displays. <a class=\" u-underline\" href=\"http://www.lexus-int.com/jp/intersect/tokyo/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" data-component=\"in-body-link\">The Lexus Intersect space</a> focuses less on vehicles and more on the whole Lexus lifestyle – from food to fashion – positioning itself as a cultural hub more than a showroom.</p>\r\n<p>Today, play is a serious business in the retail environment. Being playful and engaging brings brands to life, making them stand out in an increasingly cluttered, competitive and digital world. Whether big or small, national or international, brands must not underestimate the importance of play. You simply can’t put a price on experience.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

FITCH believes that retailers and brands need to look beyond 'just digital' in order to create a unique 'Experience Signature' to build competitive advantage.</p>\r\n<p>Here's something we're sure you've heard before...technology has changed the way we shop forever. People have more power to shop on their own terms, thrusting radical change and opportunities upon traditional retailers and making way for whole new kinds of retailers to enter the fray. All these retailers are chasing the Holy Grail of seamless shopping - a future where multiple shopping channels work in concert to achieve two main goals for people:</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">1. Improving the ease of shopping: S</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">olving various pain points from \"choice anxiety\" to delivery.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">2. Making shopping about more than the purchase: C</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">reating joy-filled experiences where people can dream of a better world for themselves, learn new things, have fun and fall in love with retailers.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Most retailers are busy creating omni-channel teams, revising organizational silos and mashing up skills in e-commerce, retailing and marketing functions. Because technology is such an important catalyst for seamless shopping, it has, understandably, stolen much of the spotlight.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Beyond the \"just add water\" approach</strong></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">We see a worrying imbalance taking place at traditional re</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">tailers. We call it the \"just add water\" approach to bringing technology in store. It's typified by placing a tablet-based catalogue next to a rack of products  on display. These digital devices remain largely ignored in store and aren't used for their intended purpose of promoting the long-tail of products from that retailer. Clearly, a more holistic approach is required to reach consumers whether they're in a store, at home or on the move. While e-commerce is a more mature shopping vehicle, applying technology in stores is in its infancy.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"WordSection1\">\r\n<p>As we inch closer to a seamless shopping future, we must appreciate how all the basic building blocks of a retail experience can combine to improve the ease of shopping, target different shopper mind states and create distinctive new experiences. FITCH has distilled the essential building blocks of any shopping experience into the following elements:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Physical</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">A structure that can be visited, be it a traditional shop, a pop-up store or something more nomadic.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Human</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>The dynamic interaction that only real people can provide, whether it is face-to-face, over the phone or through digital tools like instant messaging. We include interactions between retail employees and customers, but also between customers and any other peer involved in the decision-making or support process.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Digital</strong></p>\r\n<p>Technology tools to help shopping including broadcast, interactive and personal devices.</p>\r\n<p>Each of the three PHD elements possesses certain advantages that are impossible to replicate in any other element. We all get excited about touching products we love, whether it's a mobile phone or new dress (Physical). Sometimes, when we need an opinion or an affirmation of how we feel about a product, we may turn to a salesperson or a friend (Human). On the other hand, there is no way for a physical setting like a store to replicate the endless product selection that's available in the digital setting of an e-commerce shop (Digital).</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">There are some absolutes that retailers can and should take ad</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">vantage of. For example, traditional bricks and mortar retailers should remember that people still need to leave the house and take excursions. That's an opportunity to make the store visit more enjoyable and shift the chore-like tasks online if possible. Direct retailers with a call center need to recognize that scripted conversations are a poor cousin to dynamic genuine dialogue with real people.</span></p>\r\n<h3>Planning the seamless experience</h3>\r\n<p>Thinking about the advantages specific to each PHD element helps us plan seamless experiences. The idea, of course, is to blend these elements to create different ways for people to shop. But the way we blend the elements creates big differences in the shopping experiences and helps define retail brands.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Consider the Human element, for example. The stated strategy of UK department store John Lewis places employees at the top of its priorities. Customers feel confidence and trust in the brand as a result. While the retailer has a considerable online business, it's the quality of the human interaction that creates the difference in the experience. Similarly, apparel retailer Zappos has built a $1 billion business on the strength of creating great interaction between its customers and employees. But Zappos is exclusively an online retailer. Zappos calls itself an online service leader and wants to be known for the absolute best service. While John Lewis and Zappos play in different channels, they both have recognized that human interaction is paramount to maintaining a unique experience and a unique brand.</span></p>\r\n<p>The way in which each PHD element is deployed creates another level of difference. For example, Zappos and the fast fashion retailer Uniqlo both over index on the human element in the experience they engineer, but their employees are deployed in different ways. Zappos employees are highly trained in sales and problem resolution, and given a wide mandate to delight customers. Uniqlo floods its stores with employees, compared to its competition, but these employees are trained to help customers find what they are looking for, make easy returns and keep the merchandise looking great.</p>\r\n<p>The combinations of the PHD elements create a unique Experience Signature that differentiates and produces competitive advantages for retail brands. Walmart and John Lewis both began life as single channel brands. Both have become multichannel brands. One day, both will create seamless experiences for their customers. But the difference in the way these retailers deploy their PHD elements will continue to define how they are perceived by people, what kind of purchases will be made and the level of involvement customers are willing to commit to the brands.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Download this article as a PDF on <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/FITCH_design/seamless-retail-43589288\" target=\"_blank\">Slideshare</a>.<span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\"><br /></span></p>",

But interior design is much more than this; it imagines remarkable experiences that touch all the senses in a way other design disciplines cannot. It stimulates impressions that move people emotionally in an instant, day to day or forever.</p>\r\n<p>Interiors are everywhere, we live in them, shop in them, eat in them or simply travel through them. They keep us warm and provide a backdrop to other activities. There are those, however, that make us want to look further, stay longer or reappraise the space and the brand we are with.</p>\r\n<p>Of course Interior design must be 'effective and should create a setting' but it should go further and evoke a visceral response that wonders at both the idea behind the space and the excellence of delivery in equal measure. It should use planes, materials and technology to make spaces that lead or disrupt the eye on a physical journey. From approach, to arrival, to the moment when you are enveloped in a world that works in harmony with the overall structure or despite it.</p>",

In examining shoppers who value using multiple channels (both in-store and online), we can see that retailers are failing to deliver most in the area of Dreaming, followed by Exploring, and then Locating.</p>",

The research shows the Locating dimension Making things easier to find and Helping shoppers feel reassured still represents the cornerstone of the retail experience. This is where retailers have traditionally focused their efforts, but clearly if retailers fail to help shoppers locate effectively, then they are failing at the first post.</p>\r\n<p>Fashion retailers are perceived to fall short in this area in terms of finding things and reassurance of the right purchase. What smarter navigation strategies could be employed and what reassurances can accompany the sale? The Exploring dimension Easily find more information on a product, and to Get help in narrowing down choices is the new differentiator. <span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Retailers who acknowledge this mindstate have some real opportunities to help shoppers. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>What curating or editing strategies could be employed?</strong> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">The Dreaming dimension Helping shoppers to have fun while they shop and Be inspired to try something new is still largely untapped: An Envision Retail survey, based on observations of more than 8,000 apparel shoppers, found that 71% of shoppers who tried on clothes in fitting rooms bought something, as opposed to only 10% of those who didn't use a fitting room.

Navigating the new customer journey</h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.5em;\">The findings of the FITCH 2012 Joy of Shopping study highlights the challenges and opportunities facing today's retail brands, as they seek to redefine their relationships with customers who have never enjoyed such abundant levels of choice and control, and whose behaviours are becoming ever more fluid and unpredictable. FITCH's research has revealed some practical tenets for winning at retail in this new world order.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>1. Don't underestimate your customers' enthusiasm for shopping and going to stores.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Today's consumers enjoy shopping. In fact, a reassuringly large proportion are extremely enthusiastic about it, and see themselves as influencers within their peer groups. Don't miss opportunities to capture the hearts and minds of your most involved and enthusiastic customers by engaging all of their mindstates in ways that are entertaining, surprising and rewarding. Turn their enthusiasm into evangelism.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2. Rethink how you define and measure customer satisfaction</strong></p>\r\n<p>In today's fast moving retail world, nothing remains static - including your customers' expectations. Old models of satisfaction need to be torn up and re-drawn. Make sure that you understand the dynamics of how your customers 'shop in the mind' so that you can deliver the right types of experiences at the most relevant touchpoints. As we've seen, happier shoppers are those that feel they are experiencing richer retail by satisfying all three mindstates.</p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Play to the Exploring and Dreaming mindstates - the new differentiators</strong></p>\r\n<p>Ensure that you're evolving your offer in line with your customers' expectations. If you continue to just play to the Locating mindstate you leave yourself vulnerable to competition, particularly online competitors. Locating is now the price of entry (and there's much work yet to be done), so find ways to make it more compelling than the competition. They are looking past Locating and seeking out Exploring and Dreaming experiences. <span>Consider all three mindstates equally when establishing future retail and marketing initiatives.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>4. Don't think off- or online. Think seamless.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Don't look at store design or operations in isolation. Consider your retail experience in totality, as a matrix, and look for ways to enhance shopper experiences across channels and mindstates. Help your shoppers move through your experience, effortlessly, and on their terms. In addition, recognise that the continuing onslaught of online communication and shopping opportunities will force you to re-think the roles that your physical stores need to play. Consider the opportunities to build your intangible brand value through real-world interactions across the Dreaming and Exploring mindstates.<span style=\"color: #66757e; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\"><br /></span></p>",

            "OneColumnText": "<h3>From Simple to Splintered to Seamless</h3>\r\n<p><em>First published September 2011</em></p>\r\n<p>In the beginning, there were shops. Places we visited to have a look round, chat with an assistant, and buy stuff from the rows and racks of stock vying for our attention, we knew what we needed and a shop was the place to get it. This model worked pretty well for centuries, and was still the relevant scenario less than 20 years ago when everybody - retailers, manufacturers and shoppers - seemed to know where they fitted in. Life was simple.</p>\r\n<h3>The Internet is born</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WordSection1\">\r\n<p>Time moves fast and Y2K seems  like yesterday - our computers didn't crash but the dotcom bubble did burst. In 1991, Tim Berners Lee made the first internet software available, by 1995 Amazon and eBay were launched, BOO.com came and went in a matter of 18 months (along with $135m of investment) and by 2004, nine years after its humble beginning, Amazon made  its first full year of profit. During this time we were finding that shopping was also a pastime practised while sitting at home with a PC, and popping to the shops was a mere click away.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">For retailers and brands, the sands were clearly shifting as they worked out how to operate within this Internet-enhanced world. When Amazon launched, less than 1% of the world was using the internet; <a href=\"http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm\">16 years later that has risen to 30%</a> </span>[UPDATE: that figure is 42% in 2014] <span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">(1).</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">A multi-channel world</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>So the world got a little less simple, but a whole lot more fun.</p>\r\n<p>Conventional wisdom suggests that these are competing forces - that the more we shop online, the less we'll buy in store. Not so, according to the statistics. While the global e-commerce market is predicted to <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/03/j-p-morgan-global-e-commerce-revenue-to-grow-by-19-percent-in-2011-to-680b/\" target=\"_blank\">grow by 19% this year to $680bn and to $930bn by 2013</a> (2), since the internet arrived, the total amount of retail sales space has <a href=\"http://www.atkearney.com/consumer-products-retail/global-retail-development-index\" target=\"_blank\">increased over 200% from 40 square metres (2002) to 130 square metres today</a> (3). Granted, the bulk of new retail real estate is in emerging markets whilst the fastest growth in internet sales is in developed markets, but there is sufficient overlap to suggest a contradiction. So is this a supreme act of defiance from the 'build it and they will come' developers, or are perhaps the internet and online channels more complementary than we've been led to believe? More on this later.</p>\r\n<p>Now - more game changing still - shoppers can buy things while sitting on a bus. Mobile internet and the emergence of the 'always on' consumer means the way shoppers think about, validate and act on their purchasing decisions has become splintered.</p>\r\n<p>Analysts estimate that by 2015 almost all mobile devices sold will be smart. Juniper Research estimates that by 2016 over 1-billion devices will be sold per year with the emergence of budget models like the Orange Monte Carlo and the Motorola Fire bringing Angry Birds to the emerging markets as well.</p>\r\n<p>What was simple - \"I'm just popping to the shops...\" is now splintered - \"... shopping is anywhere and everywhere.\"</p>\r\n<h3>Spoilt for choice</h3>\r\n<p>Why has the shopping scenario become so splintered? I can now buy in a shop, on a website, via an app on a laptop or smart phone, through my games console. Alongside traditional and still powerful catalogues and direct mail, I can now get deals and promotions via QR codes and see an augmented world through my phone's camera, placing exciting products in my path or simply pointing out where the nearest bar selling Stella Artois in a strange city is. I am poked and prodded by friends on social network sites where I can also start buying virtual products with new internet-based currencies. Facebook Credits (F-Commerce) is a virtual currency you can use to buy virtual goods.</p>\r\n<p>You can now even earn Facebook credits when shopping in the real world through multi retailer reward programme Shopkick. We are happy to take a recommendation to buy something from someone we have never met and who lives 5000 miles away. I can price check on the go via RedLaser and I can get location based deals from Foursquare by becoming a Mayor, or I can join a collective buying group to get discounts on just about anything (Groupon). Shops now pop up and pop off, convenience stores are more convenient as they become an event or viral installation, and if all this wasn't enough I can actually stream my products for a day as 21st century consumption may no longer be about ownership (Netflix).</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">To some this splintered shopping journey is exciting and liberating because the options available to the regular 'man on the street', or 'on the bus', or 'sitting at home' equate to variety, choice and value. Whereas to others these splinters are a sharp reminder that the retail world is moving on at pace.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">It's too simplistic to say that the retail landscape is now divided into on-line and in-store purchases. The dynamics of the customer journey are more multifaceted than that, with shoppers confidently jumping between 'traditional' and 'new' paths to purchase.</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">So back to the competitive or complementary question: Smart brands and retailers are not grabbing all of these shards at once - trying to implement a 360 degree strategy in this splintered world could leave you badly cut. The options appropriate for a traditional bricks &amp; mortar retailer may be quite different to that of a brand that has grown up in the manufacturing, wholesale or online world. The key is to understand that consumers do not see a on- and offline world; they respond to and are embracing In-Line experiences, which may mean brands and retailers choosing to do five things in- and out-of-store really well, (in-line) rather than 10 in a sporadic or siloed way. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">So the idea that online and in-store channels are competing is more to do with internal structures and supply chain economics than any mass migration from bricks to clicks. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">As the shopping experience moves from being simple to splintered, we should try to understand what affect the variety of shopping methods, choice and value has had on today's consumers. In doing so we can further understand how to respond and create a seamless customer journey that taps into emerging mind states and the growing acceptance and enjoyment of in-line experiences. The way we think about and select products is changing, whether we are a typical Generation Y, a Young Family or a thrusting Oldie who is experiencing a midlife release rather than a sports car-fuelled crisis.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Dreaming, Exploring &amp; Locating</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">So leaving typologies and segmentation aside we believe that the process of simply finding something you need, today or fantasising about a purchase over several months, is governed by three universal 21st century mind states.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Locating</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">In this mind state, the consumer is looking for a specific brand, product or service. They have a short attention span, are often replenishing their usual stock, or already know the specific product/model they are looking for. As consumers we have done this for years but now have a few more online tools to hand to help the process. In truth most retailers see this as their comfort zone and have built and evolved their stores around this Locating mind state: avoid putting up too many barriers, make sure the signage is at the right height and keep the aisles clear, quite rightly making the shopping journey easy and pain free. All as it should be. But it doesn't have to be just that, it can achieve more.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Exploring</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Here, the consumer is open-minded but has category-specific purchase intent. They have a longer attention span, may have a few options in mind but are open to suggestions and want to be inspired and informed in equal measure. The internet can quickly grow loyalty in this area as the ability to compare and contrast a wide range of products is easy. However a key component of the Exploring mindset is trial and being able to touch, feel and test drive products.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Dreaming</span></h3>\r\n<h3><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em; font-size: 12px; font-weight: normal;\">In this mind state, consumers  are actively looking for new ideas and inspiration. They have undefined needs and wants, and are skipping between categories and brands to find inspiration and the fulfilment of desires.</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Whether daydreaming at your desk or on the bus one can be 'shopping in the mind' and have that desire or interest satiated in many ways. I have never considered camping, but a friend updated their Facebook with photos of their recent holiday. And since that popped up on my mobile all I can think </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">about is a 4-man tent and all the accessories. Wouldn't it be great if we could all go to the lake next weekend...must start looking at the options...what </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">will we need?</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Sixty-five seconds of </span>Dreaming <span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">started by a simple Facebook update, followed by 20 minutes of surfing on the mobile internet finding places to go </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">and products you might need. As a retailer, how do you compete when your store is screaming 'In stock – tents over here', not 'how about and what if...?'. </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Or more importantly, instead of competing, how do you join in?</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Seamless Customer Journeys</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">The new seamless customer journey should acknowledge that any individual can exhibit these different mind states at any given moment, often switching from one to another in an instant, depending on their particular shopping mission. </span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">The trick is to both understand how best to serve these mind states, as well as the triggers which migrate between them. </span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Traditional shopping journeys used to be predominantly location based, from leaving home to crossing a threshold to leaving a store with a bag in hand, whereas the new seamless journey is often marked more by time and triggers than physical steps: a camping update on Facebook, an interactive window display, a QR code in a magazine and time spent daydreaming or shopping in the mind. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">The three mind states have major implications for a store's design, layout and communication. And just as importantly, they have implications for how retailers think about the entire customer journey and that prize: the purchase. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">So brands and retailers don't have as much ownership as they've been accustomed to over this splintered journey to purchase. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">In this section we've explored the shopping journeys of four leading brands and retailers who are turning this collision of in-store, online and out of store to their advantage. They're cleverly creating a seamless customer journey knitting together a wide range of traditional and emerging touch points.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">What does seamless retail mean?</span></h3>\r\n<h3><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Experience stores</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">As online shopping grows, it's the replenishment purchases made in Locating mode that will continue to move off the high street and away from the malls. The best retailers will respond to this by building strong and seamless links between their shops and their online experience. Recently the CEO of Uniqlo announced that their next major Flagship opening would be their website. The future of bricks &amp; mortar lies in shifting the attention towards people in the Exploring and Dreaming mind states. By setting stores up to encourage Exploring and Dreaming, the retailer can then look to build customer loyalty all the way through the journey to purchase by truly inspiring their desires and aspirations.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Higher value purchases</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">This is good news for retailers, because there's the potential here to get more value out of their customers. By redefining the customer journey in this way, confident decisions can be made about how to up-sell and cross-sell shoppers moving them from relatively low value purchases to a higher value Exploring and Dreaming-driven spend. Clever retailers like Morrisons, Tesco and REI are already working out how to help someone in Locating mode evolve into Exploring or Dreaming thereby creating loyalty, whether that be Physical Commerce, E-Commerce, M-Commerce or F-Commerce.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Sales per sq...?</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Once retailers are brave enough to let go of the idea that their stores are solely places of transaction, they can focus on giving customers a rewarding experience. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">These shoppers will then show their loyalty - perhaps online or perhaps on another occasion in-store. If they do let go of this convention then the need for vast stock rooms reduces and then there are implications for real estate strategy. But why so brave? Well, how is inspiration in-store credited against a sale online? The tried and trusted 'sales per square foot or per square metre' may no longer be the absolute measure as 'seamless retail' is much less tangible. In fact, the whole economic structure of the supply chain comes into question.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Staples is the second largest business in the Internet Retailer Top 500, right behind Amazon, with the web accounting for 42% of overall sales. In light of the growth and contribution of the 'net to their customer journey, Staples has reduced it prototypical store size from 24,000 sqft to 20,000 sqft. This proactive move has seen benefits in terms of reduced rent, lower utility costs and fewer fixtures. The in-store offer has become more targeted. As a result Staples has seen an increase in higher value business customer traffic during the week. The reduction in space and stock previously needed to accommodate promotional/seasonal spikes in demand resulted in more room for improved service in-store and a much improved checkout experience (5).</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">New ways of working</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Of course, there are major implications here for retailers and brand owners. We are gradually seeing a movement from the department silos (Marketing, Retail, Digital, Buying) to the integrated approach - yes we've heard it before but now it's really happening. This is the way splintered will become seamless. Smart organisations have already picked up on this and are aligning themselves around the customer point of view. To do this, they're turning 90 degrees, making sure their marketing, retail and real estate teams work together rather than in isolation, or worse still, in competition. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Many of the examples we have discussed took decades to reach their potential and embrace all aspects of the seamless customer journey - today we are seeing new business models emerging everyday. Some leading brands like Groupon, eBay and Facebook were only conceived a few years ago yet have caught the imagination of brands and consumers alike. Can a business afford to be flat-footed and wait a decade for success? Or will it be rapidly overtaken by more fleet-footed brands that embrace many channels in a seamless way seeing dot com, Apps, YouTube, Twitter, Pop Up and a physical store network as all part of the new experience?</span></p>\r\n<p>Download the <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/FITCH_design/understanding-the-new-customer-mindstates\" target=\"_blank\">full pdf report</a> on Slideshare.</p>\r\n<p>Sources: <span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">(1) InternetWorldStats; (2) JP Morgan; (3) A.T.

Here, services are the main focus with a fully equipped workshop and canteen in the basement. Brompton owners can come in, ask advice, get their bike serviced and have a bite to eat or a coffee at the same time. The store will also serve as a meet up location for group rides and an events space.</p>\r\n<p>Upstairs is devoted to displaying the whole Brompton range. The product is truly the hero with multiple bikes curated in a clean shelving grid. This is augmented by an interactive tabletop designed for two people to browse simultaneously. This allows friends to explore together or a member of staff to guide a customer through Brompton's catalogue. Here, shoppers are able to plan and place orders for cycles designed to their own personal specifications.</p>\r\n<p>Quirky details throughout the store nod to the fold-up bike's design. For example, a custom-made main frame chandelier is a focal point of the upstairs space, while the coffee bar downstairs features saddle stools. Infographics provide visual storytelling around the brand's history and design features.</p>",

Follow Christian on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cdaviesFITCH\" target=\"_blank\">@cdaviesFITCH</a>.</em></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">I'm writing about a box, a piece of packaging. That description hardly begins to do justice to a design icon like this, but a box it is nonetheless.</span></p>\r\n<p>There is elegance in its proportion and visual weight, potentially even a humility in its simplicity of line, but none of these properties are the reasons it enjoys the status it has today. For this is a box with a sense of history, so storied that it is recognized the world over. Anyone who receives it can recall the first time, exactly where they were, who was giving it to them and, most importantly, why.</p>\r\n<p>A little blue box resonant with meaning and emotion; a little blue box brought to you by the brand known as Tiffany.</p>\r\n<p>Its origins are not 100 per cent clear. What we do know is the color was developed for the cover of the inaugural issue of founder Charles Lewis Tiffany's 'Blue Book', an annual collection of exquisitely handcrafted jewels.</p>\r\n<p>The color – PMS1837, for those that care about such things – is a nod to the year Tiffany was founded, although not the year the blue debuted. It is sometimes referred to as Robin's Egg Blue, but is also known as Forget me not Blue – and what name could be more appropriate?</p>\r\n<p>So, here we are, on Valentine's Eve and I want to relay just one of the interpretations of the Tiffany Blue Box as told to me by someone in the know a few years back.</p>\r\n<p>In the interest of full disclosure, Tiffany was a client at the time, a fabulous bunch of folks and the most amazing collection of brand apostles – they not only believed in their company, but loved everything about it.</p>\r\n<p>What struck me about the story was how it exemplified Tiffany's understanding of its business, its guests, and the recipients of its jewels. I also loved the simplicity of the conceit: that this isn't a box at all but rather a series of moments. Of pauses, if you will.</p>\r\n<p>Our story begins before the box even appears. It starts with a man – if you'll forgive me, we'll call him a man for the purposes of this exercise. I know the story need not be gender-role specific but it's the way the tale was told to me so I'm sticking to the script.</p>\r\n<p>This man has decision to make: \"Will I find something she likes? Will it be something that will say what I want it to say? Will this be the moment I am hoping for?\" For some this can be a paralyzing moment, for others a rite of passage, for others it's something more enjoyable. But regardless of the mood, the box is out of sight until this decision is made.</p>\r\n<h3>The First Pause...</h3>\r\n<p>Or the pre-celebration. No turning back now, so why not enjoy the moment? The box is revealed and wrapping is done with the requisite care and attention. With every passing minute our man's shoulders go back, the color returns to his cheeks and he begins to enjoy his purchase, beginning to truly look forward to the moment ahead. Then the signature bow is tied just right and snipped. When all is ready, the box is slid into a blue bag, ready to begin its journey.</p>\r\n<h3>The Second Pause...</h3>\r\n<p>Just like the box itself, the color of the bag is imbued with meaning. And as our man makes his way with his gift, he is surrounded by knowing glances, a nod of acknowledgement and often a smile from those who see him. Here is a prolonged celebration of his decision and of the happiness and hope everyone who sees him knows is contained within that rectangle swinging from his wrist.</p>\r\n<h3>The Third Pause...</h3>\r\n<p>Somewhat cheekily referred to as \"the conceal\", this third step on our journey has all the cloak and dagger collusion of a magic trick – and often for good reason as the precious box is hidden in the back of the closet, or worse still, the sock drawer. But the actual conceal takes place in the setting where the deed is to be done. And may well involve the further deception of an accomplice.</p>\r\n<p>Bottles of champagne arrive masking a shape behind them, bouquets of flowers appear unexpectedly with something buried within. It's a ballet of subtle nods, winks, cues, whispers and polite coughs all designed to continue this delightful subterfuge until the moment arrives.</p>\r\n<h3>The Fourth Pause...</h3>\r\n<p>Known as \"the reveal\" or rather more romantically as \"the flash of blue\". Accompanied often by a rush of blood, a raise in blood pressure and for some, uncontrollable giggles (and that's just the person giving the gift!). Tiffany's reputation, its assurance does its job. And every woman, no matter their age, understands the resonance of this moment and the big deal that accompanies it.</p>\r\n<h3>The Fifth Pause...</h3>\r\n<p>At last... \"the unveil\". Where the elegantly tied bow comes into its own once more. There cannot be a more difficult knot to untie than Tiffany's when your fingers are shaking beyond control and you can't catch your breath or see straight. It's the biggest pause of all, and rightfully the most significant.</p>\r\n<p>Of course while I can at least try to dissect the science behind these moments, I know every step of this this journey by heart, having made these purchases myself; first for my dear mum, then 15 years ago in Boston choosing a wedding ring for my soon-to-be wife. And now performing the art of \"the conceal\" every Christmas for my daughter's expanding charm bracelet.</p>\r\n<p>In these days of friction-free, same-day expedited delivery, the idea of a gift-buying experience infused with moments of pause might seem like the ultimate anachronism. In reality, I think it's anything but. We all need more chances to take a moment and pause, even when it's not Valentine's Day. And for my money there are few moments worthy of our attention more than these.</p>\r\n<p>And so, this Valentine's Day, I celebrate the little blue box in all its glory, and the millions of moments that have accompanied it. Happy Birthday Forget Me Not. Here's to the next 170 years.</p>",

The rewards include gig tickets and exclusive preview access to new product ranges.</p>\r\n<p>To keep the conversation going and to prompt dialogue and interaction the app sets a series of 'Get Some' challenges that can be tailored to each user's preferences based on their activity within the app. All this provides Urban Outfitters with a wealth of data letting them develop a more detailed understanding of their customer base without appearing pushy and alienating a potentially flighty teen audience.</p>\r\n<p>The UO app is a clever means of making the Urban Outfitters brand a more integral part of their customers' lifestyles. With over 800,000 Twitter followers the brand has already successfully established itself in this space.

For creative companies a huge challenge has been to anticipate the feeling a product or service will give a customer – how does it emotionally affect them and how can we develop this attachment?</p>\r\n<p>Virtual reality gets truly interesting once marketers successfully communicate the intangible aspect that drives emotional attachment. It can create a 'penny drop' moment with potential customers that pushes them towards a sale – when they realise your brand is the right choice for them.</p>",

When a consumer has created their dream abode they can go into a 4D augmented reality space, put on a headset and virtually walk around the newly designed apartment before it's been built. They can wander around the different rooms of their apartment, they can look up and down, at different floor finishes, they can pick up vases, they can turn on the lights and the taps – they can almost smell the bread baking in the kitchen.</p>\r\n<h3>Visualise the intangible</h3>\r\n<p>It's this 4D augmented reality experience which has visualised the intangible, it's made that dream become so real that they can commit and put their money behind it.</p>\r\n<p>Virtual reality can create that magical moment that has so far eluded marketers. It has the ability to transport customers to a different world that's beyond their imagination.</p>\r\n<p>Oculus Rift provides a fantastic opportunity for forward thinking creative agencies who can give this technology an everyday use and purpose. Today, virtual reality is less about gaming but about how it can be deployed commercially on behalf of brands to create dream-like shopping experiences in our everyday lives that creates a strong bond between the brand and consumer by articulating the intangible benefits of a product or service.

One of the </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">most intensely impacted categories – and an excellent case </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">study of how to remain relevant, or not – is cars, and the fate </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">of traditional car showrooms.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Not only do car brands have to entice increasingly timescarce </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">customers to their showroom, they also have to </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">provide an experience that caters to visitors who may already </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">have extensively researched their potential purchase. In this </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">changing landscape the out-of-town showroom is simply not </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">cutting it.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">As the car-buying process evolves, car dealerships must <span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">introduce radical and rapid change if they are to resonate </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">with today’s car buyer. Simply put, consumers are no longer </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">interested in driving to industrial parks on the outskirts of town </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">to speak to car dealers who too often know little more about </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">the car than they do. Our research shows that dealership </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">visits in most Western Europe markets have become much </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">less frequent in the path to purchase, with one or two visits at </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">most. Car brands have to be far more proactive in engaging </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">and enticing their audience.</span></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p2\">Old tactics fail new expectations</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">As with most major purchases today, car shopping begins <span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">online. Nobody today looks to spend the amount it costs for </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">a new or second-hand car without exhaustive investigation </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">on the Web, seeking to understand the differences, attributes </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">and performances across those cars they desire. Researching </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">through blogs and looking for discounts on comparison sites </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">- in fact, investigating your dream car can be done almost </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">entirely online. The showroom visit is the final step on this </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">journey, where buyers can justify their decision and test-drive </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">their new car, although our research shows even the test drive </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">is on the decline. This means traditional key sales tactics are </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">no longer valid. The idiom, “75 percent are more likely to buy if </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">it's been test driven,” no longer holds.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">The automotive industry as a whole has been slow to react </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">to the changing world of the consumer. The industry still </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">expects potential customers to spend their valuable weekends </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">traipsing out to showrooms, where they'll be given a weak </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">cup of coffee and forced to listen to salesmen convince them </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">they have their best interests at heart. Manufacturer websites </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">generally still have poor navigation and unclear information – </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">a clear sign that what they really want is to bring you into their </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">space to control the sale.</span></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p2\">Go to the customer</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Dealerships need to take themselves to the customer. The <span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">advent of pop-up is beginning to be seen on a still limited </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">but more regular basis. Innovative car brands, such as Tesla, </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">are beginning to appear in high footfall <a href=\"http://www.drive.com.au/motor-news/tesla-to-open-retail-stores-in-australian-shopping-centres-20141209-123o9q.html\" target=\"_blank\">shopping centers and </a></span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\"><a href=\"http://www.drive.com.au/motor-news/tesla-to-open-retail-stores-in-australian-shopping-centres-20141209-123o9q.html\" target=\"_blank\">travel hubs</a>, while test drives are being organized through </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">brand spaces and connections to nearby car parks. Gradually </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">we are seeing car brands reacting to time-starved modern </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">lifestyles, where the test-drive comes to you. The <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/86018620\" target=\"_blank\">Fiat Live </a></span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\"><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/86018620\" target=\"_blank\">Store</a> in Brazil even allows a one-to-one consultation without </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">the customer having to leave home. People can get an online </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">tour of vehicles from consultants wearing head-mounted </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">cameras.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Innovative brands are also reconfiguring the showroom to <span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">create more contemporary, welcoming environments, less </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">of a male domain as more women are making the decisions </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">on car purchases. Research suggests women influence 80 </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">percent of car purchases in the US. The <a href=\"http://www.lexus-int.com/intersect/tokyo/\" target=\"_blank\">Lexus Intersect</a> space </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">in Tokyo, for example, focuses less on the vehicles and more </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">on the whole Lexus lifestyle, from food to fashion. These are </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">easily accessible retail spaces where the customer can fully </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">experience the brand. The traditional, slick-suited salesman </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">incentivized to deliver the hard sell is making way for more </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">attentive and approachable assistants who can foster a relaxed </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">dialogue and help support a longer-term relationship that </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">importantly extends beyond the purchase.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\"><a href=\"https://www.audi.co.uk/audi-innovation/audi-city.html\" target=\"_blank\">Audi City</a> in London has created a tech-enhanced space where </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">visitors are encouraged to explore and configure their ideal </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">car using touchscreens and multisensory displays. Staff guide </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">customers through a huge range of options, understanding </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">their needs and explaining the implications of each choice. </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">As the look and performance of cars becomes more and </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">more similar, showrooms need to highlight the importance </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">of technological innovation and personalization. This will </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">become even more critical once the industry decides which </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">way to jump on the connected car debate.</span></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p2\">Reinventing retail</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">The dealership process is being fundamentally reinvented. <span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Just as supermarkets have segmented into superstores </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">and convenience stores, so dealerships must consider how </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">alternative sales formats can better reach their audiences. </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Dealerships need to proactively begin a dialogue with </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">customers long before they reach the showroom, and </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">maintain it long after they have left. They need to make the </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">service experience outstanding and the space an environment </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">where the customer can get to know the brand and vice </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">versa. Creating a reason to visit is key to the success of the </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">dealership. It must be a space where customers can take </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">the full purchasing journey – from dreaming to exploring </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">and locating. Dealers need to help customers meet and </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">connect with the brand and get a taste for the manufacturer's </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">experience signature. This is what will drive sales - not bad </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">coffee on an industrial estate.</span></p>\r\n<p> </p>",
